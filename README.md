Zaal Esartia — Portfolio

This is a small static portfolio website generated from the contents of `cv.tex`.

Files:

- `index.html` — main page with sections: Profile, Education, Skills, Projects, Languages, Contact.
- `assets/css/styles.css` — styles.
- `assets/js/main.js` — small interactive bits (mobile menu, current year).

How to run:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use "Open with" in your editor).

Notes & next steps:

- The site uses Font Awesome for icons; replace the script kit token in `index.html` with your own or swap to the CDN link for free icons.
- If you'd like a deployed site, I can prepare a GitHub Pages-ready setup or add a simple CI workflow.
